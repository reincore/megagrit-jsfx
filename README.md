# MegaGrit – 3-Band + Feedback Distortion (JSFX)

MegaGrit splits your guitar (or any source) into three (Low / Mid / High) bands, distorts each in a different flavour, then feeds the result through an envelope–driven feedback stage that “breathes” with your playing:  a feedback circuit that listens to how loud you’re playing and warps the distortion in real time. 

## Controls
| Slider | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| Input Drive | Master gain into the engine |
| Low / Mid / High Gain | Per-band level before clipping |
| Feedback | Strength of feedback modulation (0–2) |
| Envelope Depth | How deeply the envelope modulates feedback (0–2) |
| Mix | Dry ↔ Wet parallel blend |
| Post Gain | Final output (hit a limiter!) |

## Installation
